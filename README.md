# Day Breakout MT5

Day Breakout MT5 is a trading algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify breakout opportunities in the market and execute trades based on predefined parameters. This algorithm utilizes the MetaTrader 5 platform and can be used for automated trading.

## Input Parameters

The algorithm provides several customizable input parameters:

- TimePeriod: Defines the time period in days for the breakout analysis.
- BreakoutThreshold: Sets the breakout threshold as a percentage.
- StopLossLevel: Determines the stop-loss level as a percentage.
- TakeProfitLevel: Sets the take-profit level as a percentage.

## Expert Initialization Function

The OnInit() function is executed during the initialization of the algorithm. It can be used to add any necessary initialization code. In this code, no specific initialization is required, so the function returns INIT_SUCCEEDED.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The OnDeinit() function is executed during the deinitialization of the algorithm. It can be used to add any necessary deinitialization code. In this code, no specific deinitialization is required, so the function is left empty.

## Expert Start Function

The OnTick() function is executed on each tick of the market. It is the main function where the breakout analysis and trade execution take place.

1. The highest and lowest price levels of the previous day are calculated using the High[] and Low[] functions.
2. The breakout threshold levels for buying and selling are calculated based on the previous day's high and low prices.
3. If the current ask price exceeds the buy threshold, a buy trade is placed at the current market price using the OrderSend() function. The stop-loss and take-profit levels are set based on the input parameters.
4. The potential profit/loss for the trade is calculated and displayed using the Print() function.
5. If the current bid price falls below the sell threshold, a sell trade is placed at the current market price using the OrderSend() function. The stop-loss and take-profit levels are set based on the input parameters.
6. The potential profit/loss for the trade is calculated and displayed using the Print() function.

## Custom Functions

The code includes placeholders for custom functions that can be added to modify and close trades based on stop-loss and take-profit levels, calculate and display real-time profit/loss for each trade, and provide real-time price data for analysis and decision-making. These functions can be added by the user based on their specific requirements.

## Testing and Debugging Functions

The code also includes placeholders for functions related to testing, debugging, and optimization. These functions can be added to test the code using historical market data, debug and fix identified issues or errors, and optimize the execution for efficient resource usage.
